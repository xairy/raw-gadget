Running syzkaller USB reproducers
=================================

[syzkaller](https://github.com/google/syzkaller) uses Raw Gadget and Dummy HCD/UDC to [fuzz the Linux kernel USB stack](https://github.com/google/syzkaller/blob/master/docs/linux/external_fuzzing_usb.md).

As the interface provided by Raw Gadget is the same regardless of the used UDC, the reproducers for USB bugs generated by syzkaller when fuzzing with Dummy HCD/UDC can be run with any other UDC.
Thus, these reproducers can be used to trigger buggy kernel behavior in physical USB hosts by using a Linux-based board that has a UDC.

This document contains the instructions on running syzkaller USB reproducers on a Linux-based board plugged into a physical USB host.
These instructions were tested with Raspberry Pi boards, but any other board that has a working UDC can be used as well.
These instructions were written for syzkaller revision [b01b098ace00](https://github.com/google/syzkaller/commit/b01b098ace00ac799e10c38d3d3f1db50437eb57) (July 2nd 2024) and might need to be adapted for newer revisions.


## Instructions

1. Set up [Raw Gadget](https://github.com/xairy/raw-gadget) on the board.

    See [Raw Gadget on Raspberry Pi](setup_raspberry-pi.md) for end-to-end instructions on how to set up Raw Gadget on a Raspberri Pi board;

2. On the host machine (not on the board), install Docker;

3. On the host, download syzkaller and set up `syz-env`:

    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/google/syzkaller
    # Update '...' below.
    alias syz-env=".../syzkaller/tools/syz-env"
    cd syzkaller
    syz-env ls
    ```

    `syz-env` will take some time to set up the Docker image without providing any output; let it finish;

4. Patch the [UDC device and driver names](/README.md#usb-device-controllers) in syzkaller to match the ones used on the board:
    
    ``` c
    diff --git a/executor/common_usb_linux.h b/executor/common_usb_linux.h
    index b706663f8..f06fd5e3b 100644
    --- a/executor/common_usb_linux.h
    +++ b/executor/common_usb_linux.h

    -       char device[32];
    -       sprintf(&device[0], "dummy_udc.%llu", procid);
    -       int rv = usb_raw_init(fd, speed, "dummy_udc", &device[0]);
    +       int rv = usb_raw_init(fd, speed, "20980000.usb", "20980000.usb");
            if (rv < 0) {
                    debug("syz_usb_connect: usb_raw_init failed with %d\n", rv);
                    return rv;
    ```

5. Cross-compile `syz-execprog` and `syz-executor`:

    ``` bash
    syz-env make generate
    syz-env GOARM=5 make TARGETARCH=arm execprog
    syz-env make TARGETARCH=arm executor
    ```

    `GOARM=5` is only required for boards that don't support hardware floating point instructions (such as Raspberry Pi Zero);


6. Copy `./bin/linux_arm/syz-execprog` and `./bin/linux_arm/syz-executor` onto the board.

    For a Raspberry Pi, one option to copy the files is to enable the SSH server [via](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/remote-access.html#ssh) `sudo raspi-config`.

    Another option is to copy the files onto the SD card;

7. On the board, check that you can execute a simple syzkaller program:

    ``` bash
    $ cat socket.log
    r0 = socket$inet_tcp(0x2, 0x1, 0x0)
    $ sudo ./syz-execprog -executor ./syz-executor -threaded=0 -collide=0 -procs=1 -enable='' -debug socket.log
    ```

    Make sure that you see these lines at the end of the output:

    ```
    #0 [134ms] -> socket$inet_tcp(0x2, 0x1, 0x0)
    #0 [134ms] <- socket$inet_tcp=0x3
    ```

    Seeing various failure messages before that is normal;

8. You should now be able to execute syzkaller USB programs:

    ``` bash
    $ cat usb.log
    r0 = syz_usb_connect(0x0, 0x24, &(0x7f00000001c0)={{0x12, 0x1, 0x0, 0x8e, 0x32, 0xf7, 0x20, 0xaf0, 0xd257, 0x4e87, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x1, [{{0x9, 0x2, 0x12, 0x1, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, [{{0x9, 0x4, 0xf, 0x0, 0x0, 0xff, 0xa5, 0x2c}}]}}]}}, 0x0)
    $ sudo ./syz-execprog -executor ./syz-executor -slowdown=3 -threaded=0 -collide=0 -procs=1 -enable='' -debug usb.log
    ```

    The `slowdown` parameter is a scaling factor which can be used for increasing the syscall timeouts.

    Upon executing this program, a new USB device should appear on the host for a brief moment.

You now can get and run any pure USB bug reproducer from the `ci2-upstream-usb` [syzbot manager](https://syzkaller.appspot.com/upstream?manager=ci2-upstream-usb).
Note that pure USB reproducers should only contain pseudo-syscalls that start with `syz_usb_`.
If a reproducer contains other syscalls, it requires interacting with the USB stack from the host side and thus cannot be executed via the described method.
