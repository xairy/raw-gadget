Raw Gadget Tests
================

A test suite for testing Raw Gadget with different UDCs.
Based on the [usbtest](http://www.linux-usb.org/usbtest/) testing module.
All tests are supposed to be first run with `g_zero` kernel module as a baseline, and then with a userspace [gadget implementation](./gadget.c) based on Raw Gadget.

## How to Run

Note, that `usbtest` and `g_zero` modules can be native to the kernels running on the host and gadget sides, while `dummy_hcd` and `raw_gadget` are better be built manually (to make sure they are up-to-date).

Note, that when using Dummy UDC, the host and the device are the same machine.

Note, that `g_zero` binds to the first available UDC, make sure it's the right one.

Running the tests:

0. On both host and gadget sides: `make`.

1. On the host side: `./insmod_usbtest.sh`.

2. On the gadget side: `./insmod_g_zero.sh`

3. On the host side: find out the device address via `lsusb`.

4. On the host side: `./run_tests.py /dev/bus/usb/005/002 ./logs/UDC-g_zero.log`.

5. On the gadget side: `rmmod g_zero`.

6. On the gadget side: load `raw_gadget` module if not already loaded.

7. On the gadget side: `./gadget DEVICE DRIVER`.

8. On the host side: `./run_tests.py /dev/bus/usb/005/002 ./logs/UDC-raw_gadget.log`.

9. On the host side: `./format_results.py ./logs/UDC-raw_gadget.log ./logs/UDC-g_zero.log`.

## TODO

* Add more checks into `gadget.c` and detect failure when those fail.

* Test more speeds (`0x201`, `0x210`, `0x320`) and protocol versions (USB 3.0+).

* Isochronous transfer tests (`usbtest` #15, #16, #22, #23).

* USB 3 Streams tests (not implemented in kernel yet).

* Run www.usb.org USBCV tests (see [linux-usb.org](http://www.linux-usb.org/usbtest/) for details).

* Figure out a way to properly test endpoint halts (`usbtest` #13 is fully handled by UDC drivers).

* Figure out a way to test suspend/resume (not implemented in kernel yet).

## Results
